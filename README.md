# Rain-Prediction

In this project, we predict that whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We implement different machine learning models with Python and Scikit-Learn.
To answer the question, we build a classifier to predict next-day rain in Australia. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset for this project.
About Dataset:
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No?
